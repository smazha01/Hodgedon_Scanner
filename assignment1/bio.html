        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr/>
            
        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>I am a Junior at Tufts University from Hamden, CT. I was originally
         a pre-med student and followed that path for almost half of my time 
         here as a student, but after taking Introductory to Computer Science,
         I couldn't imagine going into any other field besides this. </p>

        <h3>What am I studying?</h3>
        <p>I am a Computer Science major with a Cognitive & Brain Sciences 
           (CBS) minor. CBS is an interdisciplinary field
           including Psychology, Philosophy, and Computer Science. I am very interested in learning more about Machine Learning and AI.</p>

        <h3>What is my coding background?</h3>
        <p>Before my sophomore year of college, I had no experience with 
           programming. Now, in only a year, I have been exposed to C++, C, 
           HTML/CSS, Scheme, ML and more. Since the intro course, I have taken 
           Data Structures, Discrete Mathematics, Machine Structure & Assembly 
           Language, and am currently taking Web Programming, Programming
           Languages, and Algorithms. </p>

        <h3>What are some of my hobbies?</h3>
        <p>I LOVE to play the drums. I am currently in the Tufts Arab Takht 
           Music Ensemble and play the precussion. I also love to go
           snowboarding and hiking whenever I get a chance.</p>

        <h3>What else do I like to do with my time?</h3>
        <ul><p>
                <li>Work part time with Tufts Sports Medicine</a></li>
                <li>I am the Community Outreach Liason for the Tufts Muslim
                    Student Association (MSA) as well as part of the outreach
                    committee for the Sharewood Clinic</li>
                <li>I am a licensed EMT, and worked for Armstrong 
                    Ambulance this past summer </li>
