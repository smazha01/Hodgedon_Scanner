1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what
   have not.

        I believe all aspects of the assignment have been implented correctly.
        An HTML webpage was created on my github.io website, in which I have
        a reference to a file called bio.html, in which I talk a little bit 
        about myself. In actuality, the file is called in the index.html file. 
        On the website, it just goes to the page when interacted with. There
        is also a reference to a file resume.html which holds my resume and 
        its functionality is the same as bio.html. I believe I also did not use
        any formatting in the .html files and only incorporated styling in the
        .css files. The only aspect of the assignment I am unsure about is the 
        .css file for my resume. I added a few rules into it, but they did not 
        perform as expected. Other than that, everything else is functional. 
        Even the web hosting space on my Tufts CS account correctly redirects
        to my github.io website.

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

        Besides using Piazza as a resource, I did not collaborate with anyone
        for this assignment.

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

        I believe I completed this assignment in around 10 hours.
